While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the use of AsyncStorage. The error message was quite generic, and it did not offer specific details about the cause. It looked something like this:

`AsyncStorage: not available or not properly initialized`

This error occurs when AsyncStorage is used before it's properly ready.  It's commonly due to using it too early in the app's lifecycle or in an environment where it's not available (like a web browser). However, in my case, it was happening inconsistently, seemingly at random times, even after various attempts at making sure AsyncStorage was properly initialized within the `useEffect` hook and only after the component was mounted.
