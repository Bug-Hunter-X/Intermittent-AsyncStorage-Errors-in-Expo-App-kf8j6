# Intermittent AsyncStorage Errors in Expo App

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using AsyncStorage in an Expo application. The error, `AsyncStorage: not available or not properly initialized`, appeared intermittently, making debugging difficult.  The solution involves careful initialization of AsyncStorage and handling potential errors gracefully. 

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains code that reproduces the inconsistent AsyncStorage errors. The error occurs randomly, seemingly without a clear pattern. This made troubleshooting challenging because the error isn't consistently reproducible.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that addresses this inconsistency by explicitly checking the availability of AsyncStorage before use. This approach ensures robust error handling and prevents the app from crashing due to unexpected AsyncStorage behavior.
